Overview for the IEEE ENCS Humanoid Robot Project
========

### Introduction for Contributors

This project has multiple teams working on separate subsystems, including AI, Speech and Hearing, Structure, and Vision. To get all the pieces talking to one another we are using the <a href="http://ros.org">Robot Operating System (ROS)</a>. In particular, we are using the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/hydro">ROS Hydro</a> release, and standardizing on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit Linux for the underlying system when feasible.

To speed development, we are also leveraging <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to bring up standardized pre-configured ROS virtual machines so that developers can spend less time configuring systems. Using ROS, the separate subsystems can communicate as needed, hopefully to coalesce, transformer-like, into one awe-inspiring humanoid robot.

To get started developing the subsystem for your team, see this <a href="https://github.com/encs-humanoid/devops">Humanoid Devops Howto</a>. We recommend you bring up virtual machine(s) on your computer before team meetings, since this can take a while on a slower network.
