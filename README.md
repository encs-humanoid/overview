Overview for the IEEE ENCS Humanoid Robot Project
========

### Introduction for Contributors

Welcome to the repositories for the IEEE ENCS Humanoid Robot Project.

This project has multiple teams working on separate subsystems, including AI, Speech and Hearing, Structure, and Vision. To get all the pieces talking to one another we are using the <a href="http://ros.org">Robot Operating System (ROS)</a>. In particular, we are using the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/hydro">ROS Hydro</a> release, and standardizing on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit Linux for the underlying system when feasible.

Using ROS, the separate subsystems can communicate as needed, hopefully to coalesce, transformer-like, into one awe-inspiring humanoid robot.

### Setting Up Your Computer for Humanoid Hacking

To get started developing the subsystem for your team, see this <a href="https://github.com/encs-humanoid/devops">Humanoid Devops Howto</a>. We recommend you prepare your ROS system(s) on your computer before team meetings, since this can take a while.
